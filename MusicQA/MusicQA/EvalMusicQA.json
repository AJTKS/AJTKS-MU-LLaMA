The slow and melancholic cello melody sets the tone for the song, which is followed by a haunting atmosphere created by the synthesizer and electric guitar. The horn adds a touch of nostalgia, while the beat provided by the drum machine keeps the song moving forward. The violin adds a layer of emotion to the song, making it even more powerful. Overall, the audio is a well-crafted mix of different genres, creating a unique sound that is both haunting and melancholic."
